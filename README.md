# dublin-bikes

This is a Python implementation to fulfill BSc. Computer Science and Software Engineering through Science (Accelerated) course at Maynooth University. The goal of the project is to understand how to pre-processing data, identity usage patterns of stations and using the Gradient Boosting algorithm to predict the free stands as well as the available bikes at a specific station at a short period of time.

### Data source
Data was obtained from JCDecaux API every 5 minutes via a server located in Maynooth University. It was stored in CSV and JSON files and are available on [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-aKHTT0b3yw1T49lE71EhrKFePPSek8q?usp=sharing). There are more than 120,000 JSON files and 100 CSV files

### How to run the project
The Python vesrion should be 3.7.0 or higher
> $ python db-new-data-preparation.py

> $ python db-all-exploration.py

> $ python db-clustering.py

> $ python db-modeling.py

> $ python db-api.py

### The application of the built predicting model
After the model was implemented, a web-based mobile application was built to make use of the model. That application located in ./DublineBikesForecast is called Dublin Bikes Forecast. Please see README.md inside that directory for running the application.
