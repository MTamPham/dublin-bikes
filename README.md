# dublin-bikes

This is a Python implementation to fulfill BSc. Computer Science and Software Engineering through Science course at Maynooth University. The goal of the project is to understand how to pre-processing data, identity usage patterns of stations and using the Gradient Boosting algorithm to predict the free stands as well as the available bikes at a specific station at a short period of time.

### Data source
Data was obtained from JCDecaux API every 5 minutes via a server located in Maynooth University. It was stored in CSV and JSON files and are available on [here!](http://)

### The application of the built predicting model
After the model was implemented, a web-based mobile application was built to make use of the model. That application is called DublinBikesForecast
